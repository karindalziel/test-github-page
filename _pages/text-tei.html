                world. It was a favorite saying of his (though he was not greatly given to
                sayings at any time, his days being so full of doings), that his Socialist
                opinions were not based upon his own peculiar needs; and that, when the
                    Commune<a data-tei-e="ref" data-tei-a-type="editorial" id="r1" href="#en1" data-tei-a-n="1"><sup><span data-tei-e="hi" data-tei-a-rendition="simple-superscript">1</span></sup></a> should supervene, as he
                fervently believed it must some day, he, Karl Metzerott, would be numbered
                rather among its givers than its receivers. </p>
            <p>In truth, he had some reason for self-gratulation. He was young, strong, and
                able to earn a fair living at his trade; and his wife,—but stop! We have not
                come to her quite yet. </p>
            <p>The shop where he bent over his lapstone for ten hours a day, excluding meal
                times, was an odd-looking structure, in a poor quarter of a city which we
                shall call Micklegard; and which, if any one should strive to locate, we
                warn him that the effort will bring him only confusion of face and dire
                bewilderment. For its features may be recognized, now here, now there, like
                those mocking faces that peered at Ritter Huldbrand through the mists of the
                Enchanted Forest.<a data-tei-e="ref" data-tei-a-type="editorial" id="r2" href="#en2" data-tei-a-n="2"><sup><span data-tei-e="hi" data-tei-a-rendition="simple-superscript">2</span></sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>The shoemaker s dwelling contained but three rooms. The front, a shingled
                frame building of one story, pre-<span data-tei-e="pb" data-tei-a-n="10"></span>sented its pointed gable at the
                street like a huge caret, denoting that all the sky and stars, perhaps
                something further, were wanted by those beneath. This was the shop; behind
                it were the kitchen, looking out upon a small square yard, opening on a not
                over-clean alley; and a bedroom above, whose front window peered over the
                gable roof, between the high blank walls of the adjoining houses, while the
                opposite one kept watch from the rear: and each, in its curtainless
                bareness, looked equally desolate and unsatisfied. </p>
            <p>It was on a cold, dreary November evening that the shoemaker put aside his
                work somewhat earlier than usual, and, after carefully closing his shutters,
                stepped through the ever-open door into his little kitchen, which was almost
                as red-hot as the huge cooking-stove, filled with bituminous coal, that
                occupied nearly half the tiny apartment. The other half was over-filled by a
                gigantic four-post bedstead, on which two corpulent feather-beds swelled
                nearly to the tester, and were overspread by a patchwork quilt, gaudy of hue
                and startling in design. Fringed dimity curtains hung from the tester, until
                their snow-white balls caught the reflection from the glowing counterpane,
                when they were snatched away, as if from the possible soil of contact, and
                fastened in the middle of each side by an immense yellow rosette. Upon one
                side of the stove stood an oil-cloth-covered table, which served equally for
                the preparation and consumption of food; above it, a steep, narrow stair
                wound upward to the room above; and on the other side of the kitchen,
                basking in heat which would have consumed a salamander, were a small
                old-fashioned candle-stand, half hidden by a linen cover, wrought in the old
                Levitical colors of red and blue,<a data-tei-e="ref" data-tei-a-type="editorial" id="r3" href="#en3" data-tei-a-n="3"><sup><span data-tei-e="hi" data-tei-a-rendition="simple-superscript">3</span></sup></a> and
                sustaining a cheap kerosene lamp; a slat rocking-chair, with patchwork
                cushions, and a tiny old woman bowed over a huge German Bible, bound in
                    parch-<span data-tei-e="pb" data-tei-a-n="11"></span>ment, with a tarnished steel clasp and corners, and
                heavy smooth yellow leaves. </p>
            <p>As her son entered, Frau Metzerott lifted her brown, withered face, and fixed
                her dark eyes and steel-rimmed spectacles upon him. </p>
            <p> “You have quitted early this evening,” she said, in the <span data-tei-e="hi" data-tei-a-rendition="simple-italic">Platt-Deutsch</span> dialect, which, with the
                High German of the book on her knee, was her only mode of speech, though she
                had lived in America for nearly forty years.<a data-tei-e="ref" data-tei-a-type="editorial" id="r4" href="#en4" data-tei-a-n="4"><sup><span data-tei-e="hi" data-tei-a-rendition="simple-superscript">4</span></sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>He nodded briefly, and then, as if by an afterthought, added, “It is the
                evening of the Kaffee Klatsch at the Hall, and I will go there for my
                supper. There is a little concert to-night, and dancing.” </p>
            <p>“And a few pretty girls, Karlchen?”<a data-tei-e="ref" data-tei-a-type="editorial" id="r5" href="#en5" data-tei-a-n="5"><sup><span data-tei-e="hi" data-tei-a-rendition="simple-superscript">5</span></sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>He smiled, not ill-pleased, but vouchsafed no further remark as he sprang up
                the difficult, crooked stairway to his bedroom. </p>
            <p>The old woman looked after him with a slow shake of her head. “I wish he
                would marry one of them,” she thought. “There is room for a wife, up yonder,
                and it is hard doing the work alone. Besides, one cannot live for ever, and,
                when I am gone, who will make his coffee and his apple cakes as he likes
                them?” </p>
            <p>With a sigh, she fell to reading again. </p>
            <p>It is quite possible that, on the sailing-vessel where her husband met and
                won her, and which, to afford him ample time for the operation, was
                obligingly blown out of her course so as to lengthen the voyage to America
                some three months or so, Frau Metzerott had her fair share of youthful
                attractiveness; but this had been swept from her by the scythe of Father
                Time, and the storm and stress of life had left her no leisure to cultivate
                the graces of old age. Of actual years she numbered barely sixty, and the
                dark hair under her quaint black cap showed scarcely a <span data-tei-e="pb" data-tei-a-n="12"></span>touch of
                gray; but the skin was as brown and wrinkled as a frost-nipped russet apple;
                and rheumatism and the wash-tub together had so bowed her once strong, erect
                figure, that, like the woman in Scripture, she could in no wise lift up
                herself. She was dressed in a dark blue calico, marked with small, white,
                crooked lines, a brown gingham apron, and a small gay-colored plaid shawl
                over her rheumatic shoulders. Her feet were incased in knitted woollen
                stockings, and black cloth shoes; and her knotted brown fingers showed
                beneath black cloth mittens. </p>
            <p>She did not trouble herself greatly with the preparations for her lonely
                supper, when her son, in his Sunday coat, had left her for the Hall; a fresh
                brew of coffee, a slice or two from the rye loaf, and a few potatoes dressed
                with oil and vinegar, which had stood in her corner cupboard since noon,
                supplied all her needs. </p>
            <p>The dishes were washed, the kitchen tidied, after this frugal meal, and the
                mother had settled to her knitting, when there came a knock at the shop
                door. A pleased smile shone upon the old woman s face as she recognized the
                tap, and hastened to admit the person who had formerly embodied her dreams
                of a daughter-in-law, who should be the instrument of rest and ease to her
                old age. But the Anna Rolf who now passed through the dark shop into the
                glowing kitchen, had been for two years a comely young matron; Leppel Rolf,
                the stalwart young carpenter, having wooed and won her, while Shoemaker
                Metzerott sat passively under his lapstone. Rumor asserted that the fair
                Anna had been somewhat piqued by this same passivity; but, however that may
                be, it was certainly no love-lorn personage who now added the radiance of
                youth, health, and beauty to the glow of the fire and the yellow light of
                the kerosene lamp. </p>
            <p>Yet Anna was not strictly a beauty, though her vivid <span data-tei-e="pb" data-tei-a-n="13"></span>coloring,
                sparkling eyes, and overflowing vitality had gained her that reputation. She
                was simply a tall, well-made woman, with an abundance of silky black hair, a
                rich, dark complexion, and features which, like her figure, seemed likely to
                be sharpened, rather than filled out, by advancing years. She was dressed
                with a good deal of taste, in a new, black silk, with a bunch of crimson
                roses in her bosom; and her greeting was interfused by the consciousness of
                such array. </p>
            <p>“So you are not at the Kaffee-Visite, Frau Metzerott?”she asked, laughing a
                good deal. Laughing was very becoming to Anna; she had such charming
                dimples, and strong, white, even teeth. </p>
            <p>“Kaffee-Visite, indeed!” grumbled the old woman, taking, with her withered
                hand to her wrinkled brow, a leisurely survey of her radiant visitant. “What
                should an old woman like me do there? I drink my coffee at home, and am
                thankful. But, <span data-tei-e="hi" data-tei-a-rendition="simple-italic">Du lieber Himmel!</span><a data-tei-e="ref" data-tei-a-type="editorial" id="r6" href="#en6" data-tei-a-n="6"><sup><span data-tei-e="hi" data-tei-a-rendition="simple-superscript">6</span></sup></a> how fine you are, Anna!
                A new silk dress?”</p>
            <p>“Of course,” said Anna proudly, “and all my own doing, too. Not a penny of
                Leppel’s money in it, from the neck to the hem. My earning and my making,
                Frau Metzerott.” </p>
            <p>“<span data-tei-e="hi" data-tei-a-rendition="simple-italic">Ach, Herr Gott!</span>”<a data-tei-e="ref" data-tei-a-type="editorial" id="r7" href="#en7" data-tei-a-n="7"><sup><span data-tei-e="hi" data-tei-a-rendition="simple-superscript">7</span></sup></a> sighed the old woman, smoothing down the rich folds, half
                enviously, not for herself, but for her son, whose wife might have worn
                them; ”but what a clever child you are, Aenchen.”<a data-tei-e="ref" data-tei-a-type="editorial" id="r8" href="#en8" data-tei-a-n="8"><sup><span data-tei-e="hi" data-tei-a-rendition="simple-superscript">8</span></sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>“You see,” said Anna, “it was this way. You remember when I was first married
                we lived at his home, and when I had swept and dusted a bit, there was no
                more to be done, for Frau Rolf lets no one help with the cooking. I don t
                believe she would trust an angel from heaven to work down a loaf of
                Pumpernickel for her.” She laughed again, and Frau Metzerott added a shrill
                cackle as her own contribution.</p>
            <span data-tei-e="pb" data-tei-a-n="14"></span>
            <p> “So, as twirling my thumbs never agreed with me,” continued Anna, “I just
                apprenticed myself to a dressmaker; for it is well to have two strings to
                one’s bow, and Leppel’s life is no surer than any other man’s.” </p>
            <p>“But, Anna—?” </p>
            <p>“Yes, I know, Mütterchen.<a data-tei-e="ref" data-tei-a-type="editorial" id="r9" href="#en9" data-tei-a-n="9"><sup><span data-tei-e="hi" data-tei-a-rendition="simple-superscript">9</span></sup></a> It was a special
                arrangement, of course, not a regular apprenticeship. I was to give so many
                hours a day to work I already knew how to do, such as running up seams and
                working buttonholes; and she was to teach me to cut and fit. She knew me,
                you see, and wasn’t afraid of losing by the bargain.” </p>
            <p> “I should think not!” said Frau Metzerott admiringly. She had heard the
                story at least a dozen times, and never failed to adorn the right point with
                the proper ejaculation. </p>
            <p>“Well, then,” continued Anna, “what should happen but little Fritz came to
                town, and any one but me would have had enough to do at home; but I <span data-tei-e="hi" data-tei-a-rendition="simple-italic">never</span> give up!”—she drew herself up
                proudly—"and so, since I finished my course, I have earned enough money to
                buy this dress.” </p>
            <p>“And yet you do so much besides,” said Frau Metzerott. </p>
            <p>“Since his father and mother went to live with their son in the West,” said
                Anna, “I do all my own work, make my own clothes and Fritz’s, and take in
                sewing besides.” </p>
            <p>“What a girl you are!” sighed the old woman. “But why are you home so early
                from the Hall to-night?”</p>
            <p>“Leppel is gone to New York on business. There is some new machine he wants
                to look at. I wish he would let them all alone, and attend to his day’s
                work. I did not bargain to marry an inventor,” said Anna discontentedly. </p>
            <p> “It is expensive going to New York,” said the old woman, shaking her head. </p>
            <p>“It is expensive inventing,” said the young one, her brilliant face darkened
                by a shadow of real anxiety. “But, however, he must have his own way, and
                the money is his. <span data-tei-e="pb" data-tei-a-n="15"></span>So he was off from the Hall, when he had had
                his supper, and of course,” with a conscious laugh —"he would not leave me
                there without him.” </p>
            <p>“No, no,” said the Frau, her withered lips expanding into a toothless smile,
                “you are much too pretty for that, Aenchen.” </p>
            <p>“The new pastor was there,” said Anna, when she had playfully shaken the old
                woman by her bowed shoulders, in acknowledgment of this remark, “and, I
                think, the Frau Pastorin that will be.” </p>
            <p>“So?” exclaimed the old woman eagerly; ”who is she, Anna?”</p>
            <p>“She came over on the same steamer as the Herr Pastor, and her name is
                Dorothea Weglein. It seems she had a sweetheart here in Micklegard, and came
                over to be married to him; but when she arrived he had died in the mean
                time, of something or other, very sudden, I don’t know what.” </p>
            <p>“Poor child! And the Herr Pastor is courting her?”</p>
            <p>Anna shrugged her shoulders. “It looks like it,” she said. “It seems she got
                a service place after her <span data-tei-e="hi" data-tei-a-rendition="simple-italic">Schatz</span><a data-tei-e="ref" data-tei-a-type="editorial" id="r10" href="#en10" data-tei-a-n="10"><sup><span data-tei-e="hi" data-tei-a-rendition="simple-superscript">10</span></sup></a> died. The Herr Pastor
                could do better than that. But some one else was taken with her baby face
                and frightened ways, Frau Metzerott. Your son was eating her up with his
                eyes when I came away.” </p>
            <p>“Did her <span data-tei-e="hi" data-tei-a-rendition="simple-italic">Schatz</span> leave any money behind
                him?” asked the Frau. </p>
            <p>Anna laughed a little shrilly, as she moved towards the door. “You know they
                weren’t married, Mütterchen; so, if he did, it probably went to his
                relations. Well, it is two years since it happened; she will be easily
                consoled. Good-night, Fritz will be wanting me. I only ran over to tell you
                the news,” and she was gone, leaving the shop and kitchen darker and stiller
                than ever, by contrast.</p>
            <span data-tei-e="pb" data-tei-a-n="16"></span>
            <p>Karl Metzerott, meanwhile, had walked briskly enough to meet his fate, but
                with small thought of new Herr Pastors or possible Frau Pastorins. He was
                his mother’s own son in appearance, every one had said, when both were
                younger; at present, the resemblance was less striking. Karl was a man of
                nearly thirty, who looked older than his years; of average height, strongly
                and squarely made, the shoulders slightly rounded by his occupation, the
                head a little large, with a fine, square brow, and a thick covering of
                coarse black hair. The eyes were keen and clear, the features strong and
                rugged. The skin was dark, not particularly fine, but clear and healthful;
                he wore neither beard nor mustache, and his manner showed no slightest
                consciousness of himself or his Sunday clothes. </p>
            <p>But it is best that we should precede him, rapid as are his steps, and gain
                some knowledge of the scene whither he is bound. The Maennerchor of
                Micklegard held its collective head rather higher than any similar
                association in the city. In its own opinion, its members, or the majority of
                them, were more aristocratic, its club-house better fitted up, its
                auditorium larger, and its inventive genius greater, than those of any
                contemporary. Nor shall I attempt to disprove this innocently vain
                assumption on the part of the Maennerchor, though vanity, whether innocent
                or the reverse, is said by some to be a part of the German national
                character. Others doubt whether such a thing exists as a national type of
                character. My own individual opinion is that, so far as it <span data-tei-e="hi" data-tei-a-rendition="simple-italic">does</span> exist, the Germans are no vainer,
                    <span data-tei-e="hi" data-tei-a-rendition="simple-italic">au fond</span>,<a data-tei-e="ref" data-tei-a-type="editorial" id="r11" href="#en11" data-tei-a-n="11"><sup><span data-tei-e="hi" data-tei-a-rendition="simple-superscript">11</span></sup></a> than any other people; but that what vanity they
                possess is of a surface, childlike type, more quickly recognized, but rather
                less offensive, than the vanity of, say, an Englishman. </p>
            <p>But to return to the Maennerchor. </p>
            <p>The managers had, of late, at the instigation of the <span data-tei-e="pb" data-tei-a-n="17"></span>Ladies’
                Chorus, issued invitations to a Kaffee-Visite, as it was officially termed;
                familiarly known as a “Kaffee Klatsch,” or Coffee Scandal. The ladies were
                to meet at three o clock, said the program (and we assure our readers that
                we translate from a veritable document), in the club house parlor; from
                three to five was to be theirs alone. </p>
            <p>“Needle-work, Gossip, Stocking-knitting,” said the program, with a shriek of
                triumph. At five was to be served the “Ladies’ Coffee;” from 6:30 to 8:30,
                “Supper for Gentlemen”; and this exceedingly unsociable arrangement having
                been carried to its lame and impotent conclusion, the concert, or <span data-tei-e="hi" data-tei-a-rendition="simple-italic">Abendunterhaltung</span>, would begin at nine,
                under the auspices of the Ladies’ Chorus. </p>
            <p>In its primary aspect, the Kaffee-Visite was emphatically what is jocularly
                known as a ”Dutch treat.” The refreshments were in charge of two or more
                ladies, in rotation, called the <span data-tei-e="hi" data-tei-a-rendition="simple-italic">Committee</span>, who undertook all the expense and took charge of the modest
                receipts, fifteen cents being the charge for each person’s supper. The
                receipts and expenses usually balanced with tolerable evenness, the gains of
                the <span data-tei-e="hi" data-tei-a-rendition="simple-italic">Committee</span> never amounting to a sum
                which compensated for their trouble, while anxiety of mind lest the
                incomings should not equal the outlay was written on their foreheads during
                the early part of the evening. </p>
            <p>When Karl Metzerott arrived on the occasion we have selected for description,
                the “Ladies’ Coffee” was over, and the little parlor was full of uproarious
                    <span data-tei-e="hi" data-tei-a-rendition="simple-italic">Herren</span><a data-tei-e="ref" data-tei-a-type="editorial" id="r12" href="#en12" data-tei-a-n="12"><sup><span data-tei-e="hi" data-tei-a-rendition="simple-superscript">12</span></sup></a>, the ladies having repaired to the Hall upstairs. All
                parties were full of true German enjoyment, heightened by the independence
                and freedom from sense of obligation only possible at a real “Dutch treat.”
                Everybody was host, everybody was guest; the <span data-tei-e="hi" data-tei-a-rendition="simple-italic">Committee</span> waited on the tables, and passed small jokes, with the
                coffee and cold tongue, and the <span data-tei-e="hi" data-tei-a-rendition="simple-italic">convives</span><a data-tei-e="ref" data-tei-a-type="editorial" id="r13" href="#en13" data-tei-a-n="13"><sup><span data-tei-e="hi" data-tei-a-rendition="simple-superscript">1</span></sup></a> roared with
                laughter as they disposed of the viands <span data-tei-e="pb" data-tei-a-n="18"></span>with a business-like
                rapidity, which, in part, accounted for the smallness of the profits. </p>
            <p> Strains of music had already begun to resound from the Hall, as Metzerott
                finished his repast. </p>
            <p>“The girls are enjoying themselves,” he said, smiling, to his neighbor, who
                happened to be Leppel Rolf; but an obese little man opposite called
                out,—</p>
            <p>“Enjoying? But how can they, with no partners to whirl them around? When I
                was your age, Karl, would I have been so lazy? No, my arm would have been
                round the prettiest waist in the lot long ago. Hurry, lazy fellow!”</p>
            <p>There was a roar from the tableful at this sally, for the speaker was well
                known as the shyest of men where “ladies” were in question. It was even
                asserted that he had never found courage to ask the decisive question of his
                wife, but that the marriage had been arranged by his mother. </p>
            <p>“If there are no partners at all up yonder,” replied Metzerott, “there is no
                need to hurry. They’ll wait till I come.” </p>
            <p>His voice was a deep bass, rich and mellow; his enunciation slow but
                distinct, his pronunciation and accent those of the public schools, aided by
                care and thought at home. A shrill falsetto voice followed his reply
                with:—</p>
            <p>“<span data-tei-e="hi" data-tei-a-rendition="simple-italic">Vanitas vanitatum</span>.<a data-tei-e="ref" data-tei-a-type="editorial" id="r14" href="#en14" data-tei-a-n="14"><sup><span data-tei-e="hi" data-tei-a-rendition="simple-superscript">14</span></sup></a> If you have so much vanity, Herr Metzerott, I must
                make you a pastoral visit.” </p>
            <p>Karl turned, and leisurely surveyed the speaker. The remark struck him as in
                a degree personal, from one whom he had met for the first time half an hour
                before. The Rev. Otto Schaefer, however, as he stood under the full light of
                the parlor chandelier, seemed rather to court than to avoid scrutiny. He was
                a man who could be best described by the one word, insignificant. His height
                was <span data-tei-e="pb" data-tei-a-n="19"></span>five feet one, his proportions thin to meagerness, his hair
                and beard of scant quantity, and not even so red as they might have been;
                his voice thin and unmusical. He had been in America only two years, in
                Micklegard not a fortnight; had recently lost his wife, and was said to be
                looking out for another, in which search, though the possessor of six small
                children and a limited income, there was no doubt he would very soon be
                successful. </p>
            <p> “But you know I’m a free-thinker,”<a data-tei-e="ref" data-tei-a-type="editorial" id="r15" href="#en15" data-tei-a-n="15"><sup><span data-tei-e="hi" data-tei-a-rendition="simple-superscript">15</span></sup></a>
                said Metzerott. </p>
            <p>The Rev. Otto laughed. “I’ll soon cure you of that,” he said. “<span data-tei-e="hi" data-tei-a-rendition="simple-italic">I</span> have studied nothing else but the Bible
                all my life, and <span data-tei-e="hi" data-tei-a-rendition="simple-italic">I</span> believe in it, so why
                can’t you?”</p>
            <p>“Because I <span data-tei-e="hi" data-tei-a-rendition="simple-italic">have</span> studied other things,”
                replied Karl dryly, whereupon he was dragged away by Rolf and the obese
                little man, both crying, “No theology, no religion to-night; let us dance.” </p>
            <p>Their progress towards the Hall being somewhat retarded by Karl’s playful
                resistance, they found, upon reaching it, that the Herr Pastor had preceded
                them, and was making a sort of triumphal progress up through its very fair
                proportions; shaking hands right and left with the lambs of his flock. At
                the end of the Hall, close by the stage, stood the piano, where the wife of
                the obese little man was rattling off a waltz with considerable spirit. The
                floor was full of whirling <span data-tei-e="hi" data-tei-a-rendition="simple-italic">Tänzerinen</span><a data-tei-e="ref" data-tei-a-type="editorial" id="r16" href="#en16" data-tei-a-n="16"><sup><span data-tei-e="hi" data-tei-a-rendition="simple-superscript">16</span></sup></a>, here and there
                embraced by a <span data-tei-e="hi" data-tei-a-rendition="simple-italic">Tänzer</span>. Metzerott, who was
                really, like all Germans, fond of dancing, made his way to a group near the
                piano, among whom Anna Rolf’s tall form was conspicuous. </p>
            <p>“Dance!” she cried, in answer to his request, “why, of course I will; I’d
                dance with the Wild Huntsman<a data-tei-e="ref" data-tei-a-type="editorial" id="r17" href="#en17" data-tei-a-n="17"><sup><span data-tei-e="hi" data-tei-a-rendition="simple-superscript">17</span></sup></a> if he were here
                to ask me.” </p>
            <p>“I’ve heard of him,” said Karl. ”My mother believes in him as she does
                in—”</p>
            <span data-tei-e="pb" data-tei-a-n="20"></span>
            <p>He hesitated, and Anna playfully held up her finger. “No wicked speeches,”
                she said; “your mother is a good woman, much better than you.” </p>
            <p>“Oh! She’s good enough,” the man said carelessly. “I don t see what that has
                to do with it, though; any one can be good who tries.” </p>
            <p>“Then I’m not any one,” said Anna; “for I never was good in my life, and I’m
                sure I’ve tried.” </p>
            <p>“Leppel thinks you are good,—the best of wives,” said Karl, with an indulgent
                smile. </p>
            <p>“Oh! I’m good to him,” replied Anna, “and so I ought, for he is the best of
                husbands; then I am clever, industrious, economical, and good-tempered, I
                know very well; but I’m not religious, though I should like to be.” </p>
            <p>“Religion is all nonsense, and the religious man”—and here he was suddenly
                struck dumb. </p>
            <p>“Ah! you dare not speak slanders against religion, so near the Herr Pastor,”
                said Anna, looking up into his face with amused curiosity, as they whirled
                away again, Karl waltzing on mechanically, because in his confused state of
                mind it was easier to do so than to stop. ”That girl in gray is the one they
                say he will marry. Eh? you are dancing horribly, Karl”; as they collided
                violently with another couple. “Suppose we stop.” </p>
            <p>She dropped into the nearest chair, and fanned herself briskly with her
                handkerchief, while her partner stood aside, and mentally regained his feet,
                after the shock that had overthrown him. Yet what was it after all? Had he
                lived to his present age without seriously loving; pleased here or there, it
                might be, by a voice or a face, which he forgot the next moment, to be thus
                vanquished in the twinkling of an eye? It was impossible! Why, he could not
                even recall, now that she was beyond his immediate vision, a single feature;
                only a cloud of golden <span data-tei-e="pb" data-tei-a-n="21"></span>curls on a low, childlike brow, and a
                soft gray tint surrounding her that might have been an angel’s robe, he
                thought, if there were angels. </p>
            <p>Poor Karl! and above all poor Dora! For the gray frock had been pinched and
                saved for as a wedding dress, if the young man whom she had crossed the
                ocean to find had but lived to welcome her. Anna had guessed aright, that
                his savings had gone to his relations; and Dora, in the midst of her grief
                and bewilderment, had been forced to look out for some way of supporting
                herself. For two years she had been nursery governess to two riotous boys,
                who adored and tyrannized over her; and under whose vigorous kicks and
                caresses her nature had slowly recovered from the shock it had received. Yet
                she had with difficulty persuaded herself to accept an invitation to
                accompany the wife of the obese little man to the Kaffee-Klatsch this
                afternoon; but, that difficulty having been surmounted, wearing her wedding
                dress followed as a thing of course. It cost her a pang, no doubt, but she
                had nothing else. </p>
            <p>Just how the rest of the evening passed, Karl Metzerott could never after
                give a coherent account, even to himself. Somehow, somewhere, he was
                introduced to Dora; he sat near her during the concert, silent, and
                apparently not looking at her, yet he knew her features well by that time,
                and could almost have specified the number of her eyelashes. </p>
            <p>Then he took her home, actually superseding the Herr Pastor in so doing. They
                talked but little on the way; when they had nearly reached her home, Karl
                said,— </p>
            <p>“You are not betrothed to the Herr Pastor, Fräulein Dora?”</p>
            <p>“No, indeed, he has never asked me,” she replied, laughing and blushing a
                little, but looking up into his face with <span data-tei-e="pb" data-tei-a-n="22"></span>childlike, innocent
                directness. Perhaps little Dora was scarcely the beauty that Karl fancied
                her; Anna s description, “a baby face, and frightened ways,” was much more
                accurate than any he could have given. But her large, blue eyes, with their
                long, golden lashes, were really beautiful; and nothing could have so moved
                the man beside her as the sight of that shy timidity, changed into calm
                reliance on his strength. </p>
            <p>“But you would not marry him, <span data-tei-e="hi" data-tei-a-rendition="simple-italic">nicht
                    wahr</span>?<a data-tei-e="ref" data-tei-a-type="editorial" id="r18" href="#en18" data-tei-a-n="18"><sup><span data-tei-e="hi" data-tei-a-rendition="simple-superscript">18</span></sup></a> He is poor, he is a
                fool, and he has six children.” </p>
            <p>“And he is very ugly,” said naughty Dora, deserting, without a pang, her
                oldest friend in America. </p>
            <p>“He is very ugly indeed,” said Karl Metzerott, in a tone of deep conviction;
                “God be thanked therefor.” </p>
            <p>And Dora, though she laughed and blushed still deeper, found it most
                convenient not to inquire his exact meaning. </p>

            here about the Commune as an intermediate state between capitalism and
            Communism; Marx describe the time in as a “dictatorship of the proletariat”
